# MyNook Project Structure

## Project structure rules
- Always follow the project structure requiremnents described in the file [project-structure.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/project-structure.json)
- If you want to a new file or folder you need also add a structure node in the file [project-structure.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/project-structure.json)
- Before adding a new node to the structure file [project-structure.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/project-structure.json) ask permission with fully decribed logic
- While editing a file always check the purpose of this file
- Auto-approve adding files to existing folders, ask permission only for new folder creation
