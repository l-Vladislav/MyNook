# MyNook Project Structure

## Overview
This document defines the project structure requirements for MyNook. All new files and folders must be added to `project-structure.json` to maintain consistency and enable proper dependency tracking.

## Core Principles
- **Documentation-first**: All major components must have corresponding documentation
- **Collaborative approach**: When uncertain about structure decisions, ask for user guidance
- **Conservative permissions**: Default to asking permission rather than auto-approving changes
- **Purpose clarity**: Each file/folder must have a clear, documented purpose
- **Dependency tracking**: Every file must declare its dependencies and consumers

## Structure Guidelines
- Always follow the project structure requirements described in [project-structure.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/project-structure.json)
- Before adding any new file or folder, add a structure node in [project-structure.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/project-structure.json)
- Ask permission before adding new nodes to the structure file with fully described logic
- While editing a file, always check the documented purpose of that file
- **Conservative approach**: Ask permission for both new files AND new folder creation for better oversight

## Adding New Components

### Requires Permission (Ask First)
- Creating any new files or folders
- Adding components outside the defined structure
- Changing the purpose of existing directories
- Modifying the project structure significantly

### Process for New Additions
1. Identify the intended location and its purpose
2. Define the new component's:
   - Purpose and scope
   - Dependencies and consumers
   - Priority level
   - Estimated complexity
3. Request permission with full justification
4. Update `project-structure.json` after approval
