# MyNook Core Requirements

## Critical Constraints (Always Check First)
- Max 20 cards per workspace, 10 workspaces per user
- Grid: 32px resolution, cards 2x2 to 8x8
- Performance: < 3s load, < 16ms drag latency, < 100mb memory
- Stack: Angular 17+ + .NET Core 6+ + Firebase

## Detailed Specifications
- Follow complete requirements in [core-requirements.json](mdc:docs/llm-context/core-requirements.json)
- When requirements conflict with user requests, explain the conflict and suggest alternatives
- Ask for user guidance when requirements are unclear or seem inconsistent
- Provide feedback for requirement changes with impact analysis

## Context-Specific Rules
- When adding cards: Check max_cards_per_workspace limit and warn if approaching
- When implementing drag: Respect grid_resolution and performance limits
- When adding features: Ask user about priority if it conflicts with development_priorities.phase_1_mvp
- When changing data models: Ask user about impact before updating both frontend and backend schemas
- When constraints are violated: Explain the issue and ask how user wants to proceed

## Collaborative Approach
- Ask for clarification when requirements seem to conflict with requests
- Provide options when multiple approaches could satisfy requirements
- Seek user input on prioritization when resource constraints apply
- Explain trade-offs when compromises are needed
